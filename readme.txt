## Map Animation

This project demonstrates a real time bus tracker using Mapbox GL JS library. The animation moves a marker along a predefined set of bus stops between MIT and Harvard, showcasing the path between the two locations.

## Prerequisites
- Mapbox Access Token: Obtain a Mapbox access token from the Mapbox website (https://www.mapbox.com/) and replace the placeholder token in the JavaScript code.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The map will be displayed on the page with a button labeled "Show stops between MIT and Harvard."
4. Click the button to start the animation. The marker will move along the route, stopping at each bus stop along the way.

## Customization
- To customize the initial map center and zoom level, modify the `center` and `zoom` options in the JavaScript code (`map` variable).
- To change the map style, update the `style` option in the JavaScript code (`map` variable). Refer to the Mapbox documentation for available styles.

## Compatibility
This code is compatible with modern web browsers that support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

- Mapbox GL JS Documentation: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/
- Mapbox Styles: https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#styles

## Planned Upgrades
- Add additional routes and destinations for more diverse animations.
- Implement interactive controls to allow users to choose different routes and customize animation settings.
- Enhance the marker animation with smoother transitions and more dynamic movements.
- Integrate real-time data to display live bus locations and update the animation accordingly.
